<h1>This is my portfolio project for Computer Arch and Assembly language</h1>

<p>The main thing I took away from this class is a low level understanding for how programming works and an appreciation for the debugger.  This class was difficult.  It required me to learn new abstract concepts and to implement them in a language that was very difficult and I didn't know. </p>
